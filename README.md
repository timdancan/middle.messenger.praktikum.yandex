Purpose
This project helps me to figure out how frontend frameworks implemented and allows you deploy client of messenger with authentification with API by Yandex - hurry up, let's try it :)

Commands
npm run start - to run project locally
npm run build - to build it
npm run dev - to run with watching
Available routes
/sign-up
/sign-in

P.S.: Not all routes can be reached from ui, some of them can be reached only manually
